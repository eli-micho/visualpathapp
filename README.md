VisualPath.me

This is an app for people like me who are visual learners above all else.
I noticed that having the path to learning something visualized keeps me motivated, disciplined and continually progressing.

Goal:
Create app where you can enter project you want to learn or something you're working on.
You will then break it down into sections and subsections.
These sections will be visualized and you can save and mark your progress as you go along.

Tools Used:

React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
